            <h3>High School</h3>

            <p>
              Kobe Bryant went to Lower Marion High School in Philadelphia,
              Pennsylvania. He played for his Varsity High School team, The Aces
              and led them to their first state championship in 53 years.
              <br />
              <br />
              After High School, Bryant received a lot of praise from many
              recruiters and decided to declare for the NBA Draft instead of
              going to College.

            <h3>NBA Draft</h3>

              Kobe Bean Bryant was drafted with the 13th overall selection in
              1996 by the Charlotte Hornets. However, Kobe had been traded to
              the Los Angeles Lakers before even playing a game for the Hornets.

            <h1>Kobe and Shaq</h1>
            <br />
            <h3>Beginnings</h3>
            <p>
              Kobe and Shaq were one of the most dominant duos in NBA
              History.The same summer that the Lakers had drafted Kobe, they
              signed Shaquille O'neal, a hall of fame center from the Orlando
              Magic.
              <br />
              <br />
              It took the duo a few years to work together, despite their alpha
              mentalities.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Threepeat</h3>
            <p>
              After finally figuring out how to play with each other, Kobe and
              Shaq went on to win 3 straight championships from 2000-2002.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Downfall</h3>
            <p>
              Due to an injury filled season in 2002-2003, the Lakers did not
              make it back to the NBA Finals. However, they did make it back in
              2004 after acquiring two Hall of Famers, Karl Malone and Gary
              Payton.
              <br />
              <br />
              Kobe had his worst Finals performance in NBA history, and the
              Lakers lost to the Detroit Pistons. This eventually led to the
              seperation of Kobe and Shaq the following season, and for the rest
              of their careers.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p>
              The season after Shaq had left presented a big hole in the Lakers
              roster. The Lakers missed the playoffs for the first time since
              1994 as a result in 2005.
            </p>
            <h3>81 Point Game</h3>
            <br />

            <p>
              One of Kobes biggest achievements in his career was his 81 point
              game which was the most points scored in a game in the modern NBA
              era and second most points scored all time. Kobe went on to
              average 35ppg for the season.

            <h3>Back On Top</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              After missing the playoffs in 2005 and losing in the first round
              in 2006 and 2007, Kobe grew frustrated with the franchise. Shaq
              had won another championship in 2006 as well and this mad Kobe
              more angry. He demanded a trade because he was not getting the
              support he needed and it was wasting his prime years.
              <br />
              <br />
              However, instead of trading Kobe, on Feb. 1, 2008, the Lakers
              acquired center Paul Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade.
              This miraculously changed the direction of the Lakers franchise as
              they went on to make the next 3 NBA Finals.
              <br />
              <br />
              The Lakers lost in 2008 to the Boston Celtics in 6 games and many
              had questioned the legacy of Kobe's career after Shaq. Could he
              still win?
              <br />
              <br />
              The Lakers then went on to win the next 2 championships with Kobe
              winning Finals MVP in both!

            <br />
            <h3>Quest For Number 6</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Kobe was looking to tie Michael Jordan in championship rings. He
              had 5 already and was coming off of two nba championships and 3
              straight nba finals appearances. Odds looked good for Kobe, but
              his team fell short in the second round to the Dallas Mavericks in
              4 games.
              <br />
              <br />
              The next season, Kobe's long time coach, Phil Jackson, had
              announced his retirement from the team. Kobe's odds of winning
              again didn't look too good, so the Lakers went ahead and traded
              for Supserstar point guard Chris Paul from the New Orleans
              Hornets. However, this became the most controversial trade in NBA
              history as the league vetoed the trade. As a result, the Lakers
              would lose to the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round of the
              2012 playoffs.
            </p>
            <h3>Injuries</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              The 2012-13 season was going really well for Kobe, as he averaged
              27ppg and led the Lakers to the best record after the all star
              break. However, Kobe tore his achilles in the 80th game of the
              season, 2 games before the playoffs which ended his season.
              <br />
              <br />
              Kobe returned back to the court on December 8, 2013 against the
              Toronto Raptors. However, his return was cut short to only 6 games
              when he fractured his knee.
              <br />
              <br />
              Kobe returned at the start of the 2014-15 season. He played 35,
              and also passed Michael Jordan on the NBA's all time scoring list.
              His season was again cut short after he tore his rotator cuff in
              his right shoulder.
              <br />
              <br />
              Kobe would return at the start of the 2015-16 which later on he
              announced would be his last season.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Final Game</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              In his final game, Kobe dropped 60 points! The most points scored
              by a player in his final game.

              One year after Kobe had retired from the NBA, he helped create an
              animated short film, "Dear Basketball", narrating his career.
              <br />
              <br />
              This was a huge accomplishment of Kobe's because a few months
